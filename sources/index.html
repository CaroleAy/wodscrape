            <h2>What is this?</h2>
            <p>A collection of freely available daily workouts from various places on the Internet.</p>

            <h2>Why is it here?</h2>
            <p>Recently (September, 2017) there have been an increase in the
            number of threads on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit">/r/crossfit</a>
            asking for programming tracks to follow. To reduce repeating answers,
            this page was quickly put together listing a number of well-known
            workout of the day (<strong>WOD</strong>) tracks that may help some
            readers.</p>

            <h2>Who owns the content?</h2>
            <p>The page is created by scraping WODs automatically from the respective
            owners' website once per day. All content is owned by the provider.</p>

            <h2>I'm a content owner and I <u>don't</u> want my WODs on your page!</h2>
            <p>No problem; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/angrytongan">contact me</a>
            and I will pull down your WOD.</p>

            <h2>Can you put up the WOD from &lt;such-and-such-gym&gt;?</h2>
            <p>Sure, if their WOD is freely available on their website please
            <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/angrytongan">contact me</a> and I'll add
            it to the scrape. Please note that sites that provide workouts which require you
            to login, or provide workouts through a paid subscription, will <em>not</em> be added.</p>

            <h2>I enter a gym, click <em>Add</em> and get a message saying &ldquo;Not yet configured.&rdquo; WTF?</h2>
            <p>Each WOD website is different, and so the scraper has to be taught whereabouts
            to look for the workout content. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/angrytongan">Contact me</a>,
            let me know which gym you want and I will set it up for you. In the meantime, click
            on the gym name to be taken to the corresponding website.</p>

            <h2>The dates are behind / ahead of today. WTF?</h2>
            <p>The scraper runs thrice daily (0700AEST, 1400AEST and 2100AEST) and collects the
            most recent published workout from each source. Depending on the time you view this website,
            you may see the previous days' workout. Some sites publish a full day ahead, so you may
            see the next days' workout. Sources which are stale or do not publish regularly will show
            the last published workout.</p>

            <h2>This is useful, but the page looks like balls.</h2>
            <p>This was knocked together quite quickly, but if it's popular, I'm more
            than happy to put some more effort in when time permits. Voice your approval
            or disapproval <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crossfit/comments/72467x/version_2_wods_from_everywhere_collected_in_one/">here</a>
            or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/angrytongan">contact me</a> and I'll see what I can do.</p>
